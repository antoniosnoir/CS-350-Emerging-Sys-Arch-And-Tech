# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-And-Tech

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

I added my first and last projects. The first one's purpose was to make an LED flicker, something I had never done before. The purpose of the second project was to make a prototype thermostat.

* What did you do particularly well?

I feel that I worked well from the existing code and added what was missing to make the project complete and function.

* Where could you improve?

I could improve in the understanding of the technology's architecture, especially since embedded technologies are present in more products and they will continue to have more influence.

* What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I can now say that I have worked with embedded technology, even if it was brief.

* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I can add some knowledge of embedded technologies to my projects and future jobs.

* How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made these projects maintainable, readable, and adaptable by uploading just the project code, which is full of comments that allows others to easily understand what is happening within the project in case it needs further work in the future.
